This PCB is handy for design purposes with an Arduino Nano ESP32  but can also be used to turn on and off up to 32 LED-strips or other devices that draws power up to 500mA and up to 50V.

This PCB design were kindly supported by [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com) that made the development of this PCB possible.<br>
The PCB was designed with Fritzing and the Gerber files uploaded to  the PCBWay web site.<br>
Just upload the [Gerber files from the ZIP file][(https://github.com/ednieuw/NanoESP32PCB)](https://github.com/ednieuw/ESP32ShiftregisterBWclock/blob/main/HC595ESP32V01.ZIP) to their site and pay the charges. Piece of cake.<br>
The boards looked perfect and soldering the components was easy.
